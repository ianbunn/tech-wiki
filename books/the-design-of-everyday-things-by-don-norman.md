## Acronyms and Introduction

Human-centered design (HCD)

The total experience of a product covers much more than its usability:

- Aesthetics
- Fun
- Pleasure
- Enjoyment
- Emotion

Cost and schedule are critical, the need to pay attention to competition, and the importance of multidisciplinary teams.

The best products do not always succeed. Brilliant new technologies might take decades to become accepted.

To understand products, it is not enough to understand design or technology: it is critical to understand business.

Based on psychology, on the nature of human cognition, emotion, action, and interaction with the world, will remain unchanged.

## Chapter 1: The Psychopathology of Everyday Things

2 of the most important characteristics of good design are:

- Discoverability: is it possible to even figure out what actions are possible and where and how to perform them?
  - What does "it" do?
  - How does "it" work?
  - What operations are possible?
- Understanding: what does it all mean? How is the product supposed to be used? What do all the different controls and settings mean?

### The Complexity of Modern Devices

In the best cases, the products should also be delightful and enjoyable, which means that not only must the requirements of engineering, manufacturing, and ergonomics be satisfied, but attention must be paid to the entire experience, which means the aesthetics of form and the quality of interaction.

Design is concerned with how things work, how they are controlled, and the nature of the interaction between people and technology.

It is the duty of machines and those who design them to understand people. It is not our duty to understand the arbitrary, meaningless dictates of machines.

We have to accept human behavior the way it is, not the way we would wish it to be.

Design presents a fascinating interplay of technology and psychology…So we must design our machines on the assumption that people will make errors.

### Human-Centered Design (HCD)

HCD is an approach that puts human needs, capabilities, and behavior first, then designs to accommodate those needs, capabilities, and ways of behaving.

Good design:

- Starts with an understanding of psychology and technology
- Requires good communication, esp. from machine to person, indicating:
  - What actions are possible
  - What is happening
  - What is about to happen

Designers need to focus their attention on the cases where things go wrong, not just on when things work as planned.

HCD is a **design philosophy**. It means starting with a good understanding of ppl and the needs that the design is intended to meet. This comes through observation, for ppl themselves are often unaware of their true needs, even unaware of the difficulties they are facing.

HCD principle is to avoid specifying the problem as long as possible but instead to iterate upon repeated approximations.

### Fundamental Principles of Interaction

**Discoverability** results from appropriate application of 5 fundamental psychological concepts:

- Affordances
- Signifiers
- Constraints
- Mappings
- Feedback
- Conceptual model of the system (provides true understanding)

#### Affordances

**Affordances** make sense for interaction with physical objects. Affordance refers to the _relationship_ between a physical object and a person (or any interacting agent, animal, machines, robots, etc.). An affordance is a _relationship_ between the properties of an object and the capabilities of the agent that determine just how the object could possibly be used.

The presence of an affordance is jointly determined by the qualities of the object and the abilities of the agent that is interacting. This relational definition of affordance gives considerable difficulty to many ppl.

Affordance IS NOT a property, it is a _relationship_.

An **anti-affordance** is the prevention of interaction.

To be effective, affordances and anti-affordances have to be _discoverable_ or perceivable. If they can't be perceived, some means of signaling its presence is required: a **signifier**.

Affordances exist even if they are not visible. For designers, their visibility is critical: visible affordances provide strong clues to the operations of things. Perceived affordances help ppl figure out what actions are possible without the need for labels or instructions.

##### Fun Fact

Affordances was a term coined by the insights of J.J. Gibson, an eminent psychologist who provided many advances to our understanding of human perception.

In _Gibsonian psychology_, an ecological approach to perception is taken, meaning the world contains the clues and the ppl simply pick them up through "direct perception".

Combined info, "information pickup", picked up by all of our sensory apparatus - sight, sound, smell, touch, balance, kinesthetic, acceleration, body position - determines our perceptions without the need for internal processing or cognition.

#### Signifiers

**Signifiers** specify how people discover those possibilities.

**Signifiers** are signs, perceptible signals of what can be done. **Signifiers** are of far more importance to designers than are **affordances**.

Designers need to know how to design things to make them understandable. They're trying to signify where the "touch" should take place. This is not the same thing as saying what action is possible.

People search for clues, for any sign that might help them cope and understand. It is the sign that is important, anything that might signify meaningful information.

**Good design** requires, among other things, good communication of the purpose, structure, and operation of the device to the users. That is the role of the signifier.

**Signifiers** refer to any mark or sound, any perceivable indicator that communicates appropriate behavior to a person. Signifiers can be deliberate and intentional.

**Signifiers** provide valuable clues as to the nature of the world and of social activities.

#### Affordances VS Signifiers

Affordances are the possible interactions between ppl and the environment. Some affordances are perceivable, some are not.

Perceived affordances often act as signifiers, but they can be ambiguous.

Signifiers signal things, in particular what actions are possible and how they should be done. Signifiers must be perceivable, else they fail to function.

In design, signifiers are more important than affordances, for they communicate how to use the design. Creative designers incorporate the signifying part of the design into a cohesive experience.

#### Mappings

**Mapping** is a technical term, borrowed from mathematics, meaning the relationship between the elements of two sets of things. It is an important concept in the design and layout of **controls** and **displays**.

The relationship between a control and its results is easiest to learn wherever there is an _understandable mapping_ between the _controls_, the _actions_, and the _intended result_.

**Natural mappings** take advantage of spatial analogies, leading to immediate understanding. Other natural mappings follow from the principles of perception and allow for the natural grouping or patterning of controls and feedback.

Groupings and proximity are important principles from Gestalt psychology that can be used to map controls to functions:

- Groupings: related controls should be grouped together
- Proximity: controls should be close to the item being controlled

NOTE: What is natural to one culture is not necessarily natural for another!

A device is easy to use when the set of possible actions is visible, when the controls and displays exploit natural mappings.

The principles are simple but rarely incorporated into design. Good design takes care, planning, thought, and an understanding of how people behave.

#### Feedback

**Feedback** is some way of letting you know that the system is working on your request, or done with your request. It is communicating the results of an action. It is a well-known concept from the _science of control and information theory_.

The human nervous system is equipped with numerous feedback mechanisms, including:

- Visual
- Auditory
- Touch sensors
- Vestibular (body equilibrium)
- Proprioceptive systems that monitors body position and muscle and limb movements

Feedback MUST be immediate: even a delay of a tenth of a second can be disconnecting. If the delay is too long, ppl often give up.

Feedback MUST also be informative.

Poor feedback can be worse than no feedback at all, bc it is distracting, uninformative, and in many cases, irritating and anxiety-provoking. Too much feedback can be even more annoying than too little. Machines that give too much feedback are like backseat drivers. Too many announcements cause ppl to ignore all of them, or wherever possible, disable all of them, which means that critical and important ones are apt to be missed.

Feedback has to be planned. Feedback MUST also be prioritized, so that unimportant info is presented in an unobtrusive fashion, but important signals are presented in a way that does capture attention.

#### Conceptual Models

A **conceptual model** is an explanation, usually highly simplified, of how something works, a prototype. It doesn't have to be complete or even accurate as long as it is useful.

Simplified models are valuable only as long as the assumptions that support them hold true. There are often multiple conceptual models of a product or device. The most important conceptual models are the ones that reside in the minds of the ppl who are using the product, so they're also "mental models". They're conceptual models in ppl's minds that represent their understanding of how things work. Diff ppl may hold diff mental models of the same item. Sometimes the models can even be in conflict within a single person.

Conceptual models are valuable in providing understanding, in predicting how things will behave, and in figuring out what to do when things do not go as planned. A good conceptual model allows us to predict the effects of our actions.

There is no need to understand the underlying physics or chemistry of each device we own, just the relationship between the controls and the outcomes.

### The System Image

The combined information available to the users is called **the system image**. The user's conceptual model comes from the system image, through the interaction w/the product, reading, searching for online, information, and from whatever manuals are provided.

Designers expect the user's model to be identical to their own, but bc they cannot communicate directly w/the user, the burden of communication is w/the system image.

It is up to the designer to provide the appropriate information to make the product understandable and usable. Most important is the provision of a good conceptual model that gudies the user when things go wrong.

With a good conceptual model, ppl can figure out what has happened and correct the things that went wrong.

Good conceptual models are the key to understandable, enjoyable products: good communication is the key to good conceptual models.

### The Paradox of Technology

Technology offers the potential to make life easier and more enjoyable; e/new technology provides increased benefits. At the same time, added complexities increase our difficulty and frustration w/technology.

The same tech that simplifies life by providing more functions in each device also complicates life by making the device harder to learn, harder to use.

### The Design Challenge

The hardest part of producing a product is coordinating all the many, separate disciplines, e/with diff goals and priorities. E/discipline has a diff perspective of the relative important of the many factors that make up a product.

- One discipline argues that it must be usable and understandable
- Another that it must be attractive
- Another that it has to be affordable
- Another reliable
- Others to be able to be manufactured and serviced
- Distinguishable from competing products
- Superior in critical dimensions such as price, features, reliability, appearance

Overall, ppl need to want to purchase it. It doesn't matter how good a product is if, in the end, nobody uses it. 

The successful product has to satisfy all of these requirements.

Another hard part is to convince ppl to understand the viewpoints of others, to abandon their disciplinary viewpoint and to think of the design from the viewpoints of the person who buys the product and those who use it.

If the design team has representatives from all the constituencies present at the same time, it is often possible to reach satisfactory solutions for all the needs. It is when the disciplines operate independently of one another that major clashes and deficiencies arise.

## Chapter 2: The Psychology of Everyday Actions

### How People Do Things: The Gulfs of Execution & Evaluation

The "Gulf of Execution" is where we try to figure out how it operates.

We bridge the gulf of execution through the use of signifiers, constraints, mappings, and a conceptual model.

The "Gulf of Evaluation" is where we try to figure out what happened. This gulf reflects the amount of effort that the person must make to interpret the physical state of the device and to determine how well the expectations and intentions have been met.

What are the major design elements that help bridge the gulf of evaluation? Feedback and a good conceptual model.

The difficulties reside in the design, not in the ppl attempting to use the design.

Different emotions arise at different stages, and show which stages are primarily located at each of the three levels of processing:

- **Visceral**: for the elementary levels of motor action performance and perception
- **Behavioral**: for the levels of action specification and initial interpretation of the outcome
- **Reflective**: for the development of goals, plans, and the final stage of evaluation of the outcome

### The 7 Stages of Action

Both execution & evaluation require understanding: how the item works & what results it produces. They can both affect our emotional state.

All the 7 stages of action are conscious steps we take.

1. Goal: form the goal
2. Plan: the action Determine which of the many possible plans of action to follow
   - Determine which of the many possible plans of action to follow
3. Specify: an action sequence
4. Perform: the action sequence
5. Perceive: the state of the world
6. Interpret: the perception
7. Compare: the outcome with the goal

There are 3 stages of **execution** that follow from the 1) goal: 2) plan, 3) specify, and 4) perform.

**Evaluating** what happened has 3 stages: 5) perceiving what happened in the world; 6) tyring to make sense of it or interpreting it; 7) comparing what happened with what was wanted.

Event-driven behavior: the sequence starts with the world, causing evaluation of the state and the formulation of the goal. The trigger was an **environmental event**.

**Root cause analysis**: asking "why?" until the ultimate, fundamental cause of the activity is reached. Also, it is asking what the "real goal" is.

**Goal-driven behavior**: the action cycle starting from the top, by establishing a new goal. The cycle starts with the goal, and then goes through the 3 stages of execution.

**Data-driven behavior** or **event-driven behavior**: the cycle starts with the goal and then goes through the 3 stages of execution.

The 7 stages of action provide a guideline for developing new products or services. The gulfs are obvious places to start, for either gulf, whether of execution or evaluation, is an opportunity for product enhancement.

### Human Thought: Mostly Subconscious

Because they are for humans, designs are apt to be faulty, difficult to use, difficult to understand.

Many of our beliefs about how ppl behave - including beliefs about ourselves - are wrong.

Most of our brain's operations are subconscious, hidden beneath our awareness. It's only the highest level, what we call _reflective_, that is conscious. Conscious attention is necessary to learn most things, but after a few tries, we can get to a state of "over-learning". Once the skill is over-learned, then it could be performed from "muscle memory", or with little effort, almost subconsciously.

How do we know what we do not know so rapidly? Yet some things that we do know can take a long time to retrieve?

**Declarative memory**: memory for factual information.

**Procedural memory**: recalling activities performed in sequence, like opening a door.

Human thought is not all conscious. Thought cannot be separated from emotion.

Cognitive thoughts lead to emotions: emotions drive cognitive thoughts.

The brain is structured to act upon the world, and every action carries with it expectations, and these expectations drive emotions.

The emotional system is a powerful information processing system that works in tandem with cognition. Cognition attempts to make sense of the world: emotion assigns value. Cognition provides understanding: emotion provides value judgments.

We use logic and reason after the fact, to justify our decisions to ourselves (to our conscious minds) and to others.

Subconscious processing is one of our strengths. It is good at detecting general trends, recognizing relationships between what we now experience and what has happened in the past.

Subconscious thought is biased toward regularity and structure, and it is limited in formal power.

Conscious thought is quite different, it is slow, and labored. We slowly ponder decisions, think through alternatives, compare different choices.

Both conscious and subconscious modes of thought are powerful and essential aspects of human life. Both can provide insightful leaps and creative moments. Yet both are prone to errors, misconceptions, and failures.

Emotion interacts w/cognition biochemically, via hormones through bloodstream or ducts in the brain, modding the behavior of the brain cells.

Hormones exert powerful biases on brain ops. Thus, in tense threatening situations, the emotional system triggers the release of hormones that bias the brain to focus upon relevant parts of the environment.

Subconscious and conscious systems of cognition:

| Subconscious              | Conscious                   |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Fast                      | Slow                        |
| Automatic                 | Controlled                  |
| Multiple resources        | Limited resources           |
| Controls skilled behavior | Invoked for novel situation |

A positive emotional state is ideal for creative thought.

A brain in a negative emotional state provides focus.

Both the positive, relaxed state and the anxious, negative, and tense state are valuable and powerful tools for human creativity and action. The extremes of both states, however, can be dangerous.

### Human Cognition and Emotion

3 levels of processing:

1. Visceral
2. Behavioral
3. Reflective

#### The Visceral Level

AKA "the lizard brain". E/one has the same basic visceral responses. These are part of the protective mechanisms of the human affective system, making quick judgements about the env.

The visceral system allows us to respond quickly and subconsciously, w/out conscious awareness or control.

Visceral learning takes place primarily by sensitization or desensitization through such mechanisms as **adaptation** and **classical conditioning**.

These responses give rise to the **startle reflex**.

The visceral level responds to the immediate present and produces an affective state, relatively unaffected by context or history. It simply assesses the situation.

The visceral level is tightly coupled to the body's musculature - the motor system.

This is also the cause for "fight or flight".

Tension of the body includes, negative state = tense; positive state = relaxed. We often determine our own state by noting our own musculature.

Visceral responses are fast and completely subconscious, they are precursors to emotion.

For designers, the visceral response is about immediate perception.

The style matters: appearances, whether sound or sight, touch or smell, drive the visceral response.

This has nothing to do with how usable, effective, or understandable the product is. It is all about **attraction or repulsion**. Great designers use their aesthetic sensibilities to drive these visceral responses.

Engineers and other logical ppl tend to dismiss the visceral response as irrelevant. VISCERAL RESPONSES MATTER!

#### The Behavioral Level

The behavioral level is the home of learned skills, triggered by situations that match the appropriate patterns. Actions and analyses at this level are largely subconscious.

When playing sports, our responses occur far too quickly for conscious control: it is the behavioral level that takes control.

When we perform a well-learned action, all we have to do is think of the goal and the behavioral level handles all the details.

For designers, the most critical aspect of the behavioral level is that every action is associated with an expectation.

The information in the feedback loop of evaluation confirms or disconfirms the expectations.

Behavioral states give rise to a feeling of control when there is good understanding and knowledge of results, and frustration and anger when things do not go as planned.

Feedback provides reassurance, even when it indicates a negative result. A lack of feedback creates a feeling of lack of control, which can be unsettling. Feedback is critical to managing expectations. Expectations play an important  role in our emotional lives.

#### The Reflective Level

The reflective level is the home of conscious cognition. This is where deep understanding develops, where reasoning and conscious decision-making take place.

Reflection is cognitive, deep, and slow. A reflection is looking back over them, evaluating the circumstances, actions, and outcomes, often assessing blame or responsibility.

The **highest levels** of emotions come from the reflective level, for it is here that causes are assigned and where predictions of the future take place. Emotion and cognition are tightly intertwined.

#### Design Must Take Place At All Levels: Visceral, Behavioral, & Reflective

Reflective responses are part of our memory of events. Memories last far longer than the immediate experience or the period of usage, which are the domains of the visceral and behavioral levels. It is reflection that drives us to recommend a product, to recommend that others use it - or perhaps avoid it.

Advertisers hope that the strong reflective value associated with a well-known, highly prestigious brand might overwhelm our judgment, despite a frustrating experience in using the product.

The behavioral level, which is the home of interaction, is also the home of all expectation-based emotions, of hope and joy, frustration and anger.

Understanding arises at a combination of the behavioral and reflective levels. Enjoyment requires ALL three.

High-level reflective cognition can trigger lower-level emotions. Lower-level emotions can trigger higher-level reflective cognition.

### The 7 Stages of Action and the 3 Levels of Processing

At the lowest level are the visceral levels of calmness or anxiety when approaching a task or evaluating the state of the world.

Then in the mid levels are the behavioral ones driven by expectations on the execution side - for example hope and fear - and emotions driven by the confirmation of those expectations on the evaluation side - for example relief or despair.

At the highest level are the reflective emotions, ones that assess the results in terms of the presumed causal agents and the consequences, both immediate and long-term.

One important emotional state is the one that accompanies complete immersion into an activity, a state that social scientist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi has labeled "flow". 

When in the "flow" state, ppl lose track of time and the outside environment. They are at one with the task they are performing.

Everyone wants radical innovation, but the truth is, most radical innovations fail, and even when they do succeed, it can take multiple decades before they are accepted. Radical innovation, therefore, is relatively rare: incremental innovation is common.
